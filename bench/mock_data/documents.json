    "content": "# Project Phoenix: Next-Gen Platform Architecture\n\n## Executive Summary\nOur current monolithic architecture is hitting scaling limits. Project Phoenix proposes a complete platform rewrite using modern microservices architecture with a knowledge graph at its core.\n\n## Current Problems\n1. Monolith deployments take 45+ minutes\n2. Single database bottleneck - can't scale horizontally\n3. No real-time capabilities\n4. Search is basic keyword matching\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n### Core Components\n- **Knowledge Graph Engine**: Neo4j-based graph database for entity/relationship storage\n- **Event Bus**: Kafka for real-time data streaming\n- **API Gateway**: Kong for rate limiting and authentication\n- **Search Service**: Elasticsearch with vector embeddings\n\n### Key Innovations\n- **Graph-RAG Hybrid**: Combine knowledge graph traversal with RAG for superior retrieval\n- **Attention Mechanism**: Track what users focus on to improve relevance\n- **Real-time Sync**: Live updates across all connected clients\n\n## Timeline\n- Phase 1 (Q4 2024): Core graph engine and API rewrite\n- Phase 2 (Q1 2025): Migration tooling and enterprise features\n- Phase 3 (Q2 2025): Full customer migration\n\n## Resource Requirements\n- 2 additional senior engineers\n- $50k cloud infrastructure budget increase\n- 3rd party security audit ($30k)\n\n## Risks\n- Customer migration complexity\n- Team learning curve on new stack\n- Parallel system maintenance during transition\n\n## Recommendation\nApprove Phase 1 immediately. This architecture will support 10x scale and enable features competitors can't match.",
